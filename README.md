# OnlineSchool

Project Description:
The project is a web-based online school platform that allows students to book extra classes to prepare for exams or to help them understand specific topics. There are two main roles in the system: student and teacher.
The main functions are:
Registration:
In the first phase, students will register via email. In the future it is planned to add registration via Google.
The mandatory fields for registration are first name, last name, email, phone and class or course.
Booking system:
Once logged in, the student can select the subject, date and time of the class, and optionally select a teacher.
If the student does not select a teacher, the request can be accepted by any available teacher.
Some time slots may not be available due to already booked classes or teacher unavailability at that time.
Booking Interface:
The date and time selection process should be intuitive and user friendly.
Date selection: The user sees a calendar on which they can select available days for the class. Unavailable days should be visually marked so that the user cannot select them.
Time selection: After selecting the date, the user selects the time interval. The interface allows the user to select the time in increments of, for example, 5 minutes. The user can also manually enter the desired start and end time of the class.
Teachers' work:
Each teacher can edit his/her available hours for conducting classes.
Integration with Googl is being considered
